Public information from SpaceX api and Wikipedia was used to train a machine learning model and use it to predict if SpaceX reuses the first stage of the Falcon 9 
rocket (if the launch is successful or not).
Results of data analysis are visualized with graphs, maps and interactive dashboard.
The best orbits and launch site were defined.

Data collection methodology:
• Data was collected by the Request to the SpaceX API;
• Date was collected by web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page;
• Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL;
• Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash;
• Predictive analysis using classification models:
• Best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression and KNN were found;
• The best result was achieved with Classification Trees.
